# deep-PDE
Using deep learning approaches to solve partial differential equation in high dimen-
sions. Example on the Black-Scholes equation.

The main file to configure and run the model is:
- FBSNN.ipynb

This implementation relies on the files:
- FBSNN.py
- run_model.py
- gradient_descent.py

The toys examples are:
- toy_example_1D.ipynb
- toy_example_2D.ipynb
- toy_example_implicit.ipynb
- toy_example_proxy.ipynb
